# Generative AI-Based Predictive Maintenance System

This project implements a predictive maintenance system using generative AI techniques to analyze sensor data from manufacturing equipment. The system is designed to predict equipment failures before they occur, allowing maintenance teams to take proactive measures and reduce downtime and maintenance costs.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for anomaly detection
- Random Forest model for failure prediction
- Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Continuous monitoring of sensor data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

```

2. Install the required packages:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Usage

1. Place your sensor data file(s) in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the following commands to preprocess the data, train the models, and deploy the system:

```python
from src.data_preprocessing import preprocess_data
from src.vae_model import build_vae, train_vae
from src.anomaly_detection import detect_anomalies
from src.failure_prediction import train_failure_prediction_model, evaluate_model
from src.deployment import deploy_models, monitor_data

# Preprocess data
data, scaler = preprocess_data('data/sensor_data.csv')
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('failure', axis=1), data['failure'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train VAE model
vae = build_vae(input_dim=5)
vae = train_vae(vae, X_train, X_test)

# Detect anomalies
anomalies, anomaly_scores = detect_anomalies(vae, X_test)

# Train failure prediction model
X_train_anomalies = anomalies[['temp', 'vibration', 'pressure', 'rpm', 'load']].values
y_train_anomalies = y_test.loc[anomaly_scores > threshold].values
rf = train_failure_prediction_model(X_train_anomalies, y_train_anomalies)

# Evaluate model
accuracy, precision, recall, f1 = evaluate_model(rf, X_test[['temp', 'vibration', 'pressure', 'rpm', 'load']].values, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}, Precision: {precision}, Recall: {recall}, F1-score: {f1}')

# Deploy models
model_folder = 'gs://your-bucket/models'
deploy_models(model_folder, rf, vae)

# Continuous monitoring
threshold = 0.95
monitor_data(rf, vae, scaler, threshold, send_alert)


This ```README.md``` file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, contributing guidelines, and license information.

With this structure and code, your project should be well-organized, modular, and easier to maintain and extend. Additionally, the separation of concerns and the inclusion of unit tests promote code quality and testability.
